# Resturant Inventory Management System
An application that will help keep track of how much food a resturant has throughout the day. 
For this inventory app to be useful for our restaurant owner, we would want our app to be able to answer the following questions:

- What is currently in the restaurant’s inventory?
- What purchases have been made?
- What does the restaurant’s menu look like? What ingredients (and how many of each) are required for each item on the menu? What’s the price of each item?
- What is the total revenue for the restaurant’s overall recorded purchases?
- What is the total cost to the restaurant’s overall purchases made (sum of cost of all ingredients used).
- How much profit (revenue - cost) does the restaurant make
