The save method is overridden in the Purchase model. It first calls the superclass's save method to save the purchase instance in the database.

Next, it iterates over each PurchaseItem associated with the current Purchase using the purchase_items reverse relationship. For each PurchaseItem, it retrieves the related menu item (item) and the purchased quantity (quantity).

Then, it loops through the ingredients (ingredient) associated with the menu item's recipe requirements (item.recipe_requirements.ingredients.all()) and updates the available units by subtracting the purchased quantity. The updated ingredient is then saved.

This ensures that when a purchase is made, the inventory is modified by reducing the available units of the ingredients used in the purchased menu items.
